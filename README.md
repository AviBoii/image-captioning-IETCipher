# CaptionWiz - Generating captions for images using Deep Learning

The project involves generating captions/a brief description for an image. 

# Problem Statement : 

To develop a deep learning-based image captioning system that can automatically generate
natural language descriptions of images. The system should be able to accurately identify and
describe the objects, actions, and relationships present in an image, and generate captions that
are grammatically correct and informative.

# Areas/Domain : 

Python Programming, TensorFlow/Pytorch, Numpy and Pandas Libraries  

# Expected outcomes : 
Upon completing the project , the expected outcomes are :

  ● A model that can generate accurate and informative captions for a wide variety of
    images, including images with complex scenes, multiple objects, and ambiguous
    content.
    
  ● A model that can generate captions for social media posts that are more informative and
    engaging than human-generated captions and that can be of help in various other fields.
